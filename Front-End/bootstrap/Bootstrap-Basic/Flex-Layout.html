<!-- Bootstrap utilizes the power of CSS Flexbox to create flexible and responsive layouts. Flexbox is a CSS layout module that allows elements to be arranged within a container, providing flexible positioning and alignment capabilities. Bootstrap provides a set of utility classes that leverage Flexbox to assist in building responsive designs.
Here are some key aspects of Flexbox in Bootstrap:


Flex Container: To create a flex container, add the .d-flex class to a parent element. This class sets the display property to flex and establishes a flex context for its child elements.


Flex Direction: Bootstrap provides classes to control the direction of flex items within a flex container. Use the following classes to set the 

flex-direction:
.flex-row: Displays flex items horizontally in a row (default).

.flex-column: Displays flex items vertically in a column.

.flex-row-reverse: Displays flex items horizontally in reverse order.

.flex-column-reverse: Displays flex items vertically in reverse order.

Flex Alignment: Bootstrap offers utility classes to align flex items within a flex container:

.justify-content-{alignment}: Aligns flex items horizontally. Replace {alignment} with one of the following values:

start: Aligns items to the start of the container (left-aligned).

center: Aligns items at the center of the container.

end: Aligns items to the end of the container (right-aligned).

between: Distributes items evenly with space between them.

around: Distributes items evenly with space around them.

.align-items-{alignment}: Aligns flex items vertically. Replace {alignment} with one of the following values:

start: Aligns items at the start of the container.

center: Aligns items at the center of the container.

end: Aligns items at the end of the container.

Flex Wrapping:By default, flex items will wrap onto new lines when the container becomes narrower than the combined width of its flex items. You can control this wrapping behavior using the .flex-wrap-{value} class:

.flex-wrap: Allows items to wrap onto new lines (default).

.flex-nowrap: Prevents items from wrapping.

.flex-wrap-reverse: Wraps items onto new lines in reverse order. -->
