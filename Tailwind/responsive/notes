<!-- To achieve responsiveness in Tailwind CSS, you can use responsive breakpoints, which are predefined screen sizes. The default breakpoints in Tailwind CSS are:

sm: Small screens (640px and up)

md: Medium screens (768px and up)

lg: Large screens (1024px and up)

xl: Extra-large screens (1280px and up)

2xl: Extra-extra-large screens (1536px and up)

To apply styles based on these breakpoints, you can use the responsive utility classes provided by Tailwind CSS. These classes allow you to specify different styles for different screen sizes -->
