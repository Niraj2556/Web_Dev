<!-- Node Types
When exploring the node types in the DOM (Document Object Model) in Depth, you encounter several types of nodes that make up the structure of an HTML or XML document. Each node type represents a specific element or part of the document. Here are the main node types in the DOM:


Element Nodes:
Represents HTML elements such as <div>, <p>, <a>, etc.
Contains attributes, child nodes, and can have associated CSS styles.
Accessible through methods like getElementById, getElementsByTagName, or CSS selectors.


Text Nodes:
Represents the text content within an element.
Text nodes are children of element nodes and can be accessed through the textContent property.
For example, the text "Hello, World!" within a <p> element is represented as a text node.


Comment Nodes:
Represents comments in the document.
Comment nodes are siblings to other nodes and can be accessed through methods like getElementsByTagName or by iterating over the children of an element.


Attribute Nodes:
Represents attributes of an element.
Attribute nodes are typically associated with element nodes and contain information such as the value of src, href, class, etc.
Attribute values can be accessed and modified using DOM methods like getAttribute and setAttribute.


Document Nodes:
Represents the entire document.
The document node is the entry point to access the DOM tree and contains methods and properties to interact with the document as a whole, such as getElementById and getElementsByTagName.


DocumentType Nodes:
Represents the <!DOCTYPE> declaration in an HTML document.
Contains information about the document type, such as the root element and the DTD (Document Type Definition).


ProcessingInstruction Nodes:
Represents processing instructions in an XML document.
Processing instructions provide instructions to the application processing the XML document. -->
