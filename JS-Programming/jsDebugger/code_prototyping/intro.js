// If you need a quick prototype or sample code snippet, ChatGPT can generate code for you based on your requirements.

// Example: Provide me with a JavaScript code example that illustrates the OOPs concept in JavaScript using an optimal solution.


// OOP Example: Car Class

class Car {
    constructor(make, model, year) {
      this.make = make;
      this.model = model;
      this.year = year;
      this.isEngineStarted = false;
    }
  
    startEngine() {
      this.isEngineStarted = true;
      console.log(`The ${this.make} ${this.model}'s engine is started.`);
    }
  
    stopEngine() {
      this.isEngineStarted = false;
      console.log(`The ${this.make} ${this.model}'s engine is stopped.`);
    }
  }
  
  // Create Car Objects
  const car1 = new Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2021);
  const car2 = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2022);
  
  // Perform Operations
  car1.startEngine(); // The Toyota Camry's engine is started.
  car2.startEngine(); // The Honda Civic's engine is started.
  
  car1.stopEngine(); // The Toyota Camry's engine is stopped.
  car2.stopEngine(); // The Honda Civic's engine is stopped.





//   In this code example, we define a Car class using the class syntax introduced in ECMAScript 2015. The Car class has a constructor to initialize the car's make, model, and year. It also has two methods, startEngine and stopEngine, which modify the isEngineStarted property and log the corresponding messages.
// We then create two instances of the Car class, car1 and car2, representing two different cars. We can call the startEngine and stopEngine methods on each car object to start and stop their engines, respectively.
// By using classes and objects, this code demonstrates encapsulation, where the data and behavior related to a car are bundled together within the Car class. It also showcases the concepts of methods and object instantiation.
