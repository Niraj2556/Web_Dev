// To update the DOM dynamically with data retrieved via AJAX, you can utilize the success callback function of the AJAX request to manipulate the DOM based on the received data. Here's an example:
$.ajax({
  url: '<https://api.example.com/data>',
  method: 'GET',
  dataType: 'json',
  success: function(response) {
    // Update the DOM with the received data
    $('#result').text(response.data);
  },
  error: function(xhr, status, error) {
    // Handle error
    console.error(error);
  }
});



// In this example, the success callback function is responsible for updating the DOM with the received data. Here's how it works:
// The AJAX request is sent to the specified URL using the $.ajax() function.
// Upon a successful response, the success callback function is executed.
// Inside the success callback function, you can access the received data through the response parameter.
// In this example, the response.data property is used to update the text content of an element with the ID "result" by using the text() method provided by jQuery.
// Make sure to replace the url with the actual URL of the server endpoint from which you retrieve the data. Additionally, adjust the manipulation of the DOM based on the structure and requirements of your web page.
// By updating the DOM dynamically with AJAX data, you can create interactive and real-time web applications that display information without requiring a full page reload. It allows you to seamlessly incorporate server-side data into your web page, enhancing the user experience.
