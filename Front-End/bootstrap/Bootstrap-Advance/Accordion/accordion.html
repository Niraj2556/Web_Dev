<!-- An accordion is a component that allows you to create collapsible and expandable content sections. It is commonly used to organize and present information in a compact and interactive manner. The Bootstrap accordion is based on the use of the collapse and card components.
To create an accordion in Bootstrap, you typically need to follow these steps:
Structure your HTML:
Wrap the accordion inside a container element, such as a <div>.
Create a series of collapsible content sections using the <div> element and give each section a unique ID.
Apply the Bootstrap classes:
Add the accordion class to the container element.
For each content section, create a <div> with the card class.
Inside each card, include a card-header and a card-body element.
Add the necessary attributes and data-* attributes:
Assign the id attribute to each card element with a unique ID.
Add the data-bs-toggle="collapse" attribute to the card-header element.
Set the href attribute of the card-header to the ID of the corresponding card-body element.
Include the data-bs-parent="#accordionId" attribute on the container element, where accordionId is the ID of the container.

              <strong>This is the first item's accordion body.</strong> It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
