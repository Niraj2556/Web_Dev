// Modularize Code: By isolating specific tasks into helper functions, you can break down complex operations into smaller, more manageable pieces, making the code easier to read and understand.
// Let's say you have a complex task that involves multiple steps, such as uploading a file, parsing its contents, and saving the results to a database. You can break down this task into smaller functions and call them sequentially:

function uploadFile() {
  // code to upload file
}

function parseFile() {
  // code to parse file contents
}

function saveToDatabase(data) {
  // code to save data to database
}

uploadFile();
let data = parseFile();
saveToDatabase(data);
