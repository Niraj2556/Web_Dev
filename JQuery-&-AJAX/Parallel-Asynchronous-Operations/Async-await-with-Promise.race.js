// If you want to perform parallel operations but only care about the result of the first resolved promise (or the fastest one), you can use Promise.race().
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await Promise.race([
      fetch('<https://api.example.com/data1>'),
      fetch('<https://api.example.com/data2>'),
      fetch('<https://api.example.com/data3>')
    ]);
    // Handle the fastest resolved response
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors
  }
}

fetchData();
// In this example, Promise.race() is used with an array of fetch requests inside an async function. The await keyword pauses the execution until the first promise in the array is resolved, and the result is stored in the response variable.
// Performing multiple asynchronous operations in parallel can improve the efficiency and performance of your code. Choose the appropriate approach based on your specific requirements and whether you need to handle all the resolved values or only care about the first one.
