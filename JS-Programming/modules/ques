Why is understanding the JS Module System important?
Understanding the JavaScript module system is essential for several reasons, as it plays a crucial role in modern JavaScript development.

Here are some key reasons why understanding the module system is important:
1. Code Organization: Modules help organize code into smaller, manageable pieces, improving maintainability.
2. Reusability: Modules allow code to be reused in different parts of the application.
3. Dependency Management: Understanding modules helps handle dependencies effectively.
4. Encapsulation: Modules enable encapsulation of private variables and functions, preventing global scope pollution.
5. Scope Isolation: Modules ensure that variables and functions within them are isolated from other parts of the code.
6. Asynchronous Loading: Module systems like AMD handle asynchronous loading of files in browsers.
