Containers
In Bootstrap, containers are used to wrap and center the content within a webpage. By default, containers in Bootstrap have a fixed maximum width and are horizontally centered on the page. They also provide padding to ensure proper spacing between the content and the edges of the container.
Bootstrap provides two types of containers:
Fixed-Width Container: To create a fixed-width container, use the class .container. The container will have a responsive width that adjusts based on the screen size.
Example:
<div class="container"> 
  <!-- Content goes here -->
</div>
Fluid Container: To create a full-width container that spans the entire width of the viewport, use the class .container-fluid. The container's width will dynamically adjust to fit different screen sizes.
Example:
<div class="container-fluid"> 
  <!-- Content goes here --> 
</div>
Containers should be used as a parent element to wrap up the main content of your webpage. You can add additional rows and columns within the container to create a responsive grid layout using Bootstrap's grid system.
By utilizing Bootstrap's containers, you can create a consistent and responsive layout for your web pages that adapts well to different screen sizes and devices.
