// Evaluate and compare the efficiencies based on Execution Speed and Memory Usage of the two codes provided.




// Code 1
function reverseStringBuiltIn(str) {
    return str.split('').reverse().join('');
  }
  
  console.log(reverseStringBuiltIn('Hello, World!')); // Output: "!dlroW ,olleH"
  
  
  // Code 2
  function reverseStringLoop(str) {
    let reversed = '';
    
    for (let i = str.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      reversed += str[i];
    }
    
    return reversed;
  }
  
  console.log(reverseStringLoop('Hello, World!')); // Output: "!dlroW ,olleH"






// Execution Speed:
// Code 1 (Built-in):

// Utilizes built-in functions (split, reverse, join) for string reversal.
// These functions are generally optimized and executed at a lower level.
// Likely to be more concise and potentially faster.
// Code 2 (Loop):

// Uses a simple loop to iterate through the string in reverse order.
// Involves manual index manipulation and string concatenation.
// May be less concise and potentially slightly slower than the built-in approach.
// Memory Usage:
// Code 1 (Built-in):

// Creates intermediate arrays (split and reverse operations), potentially using more memory.
// The memory overhead depends on the implementation of the JavaScript engine.
// Code 2 (Loop):

// Maintains a single string (reversed) and appends characters to it.
// May have lower memory overhead as it doesn't create intermediate arrays.
// Conclusion:
// Both code snippets provide the same output and have similar time complexities.
// The choice between them may depend on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.
// The built-in approach (Code 1) is concise and likely to be faster in most cases.
// The loop-based approach (Code 2) may have slightly lower memory overhead but could be less optimized.
// For general string reversal tasks, the built-in approach is often preferred for its readability and potential performance benefits
