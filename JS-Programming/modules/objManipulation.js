// Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Ethan who loved to play treasure hunt. He would spend hours creating maps and clues for his friends to follow. One day, he decided to create a treasure hunt where the clues were hidden in an object. Each key in the object represented a clue, and the value was the location of the next clue. He wanted to make sure he had included all the necessary clues, but he didnâ€™t know how to check all the keys in the object.
// Can you help Ethan by writing a function in ES5 syntax that takes an object as input and returns an array of all the keys in the object, representing all the clues in his treasure hunt?
// Example 1:
// Input: {"name": "John", "age": 25, "city": "New York"}
// Output: ['name', 'age', 'city']


function main() {
    var obj = JSON.parse(readLine());
    console.log(getObjectKeysES5(obj));
}
function getObjectKeysES5(obj) {
    var keys = [];
    for (var key in obj) {
        if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
            keys.push(key);
        }
    }
    return keys;
}
