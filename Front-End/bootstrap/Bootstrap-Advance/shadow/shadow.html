    <!-- To add a shadow to an element in Bootstrap, you can use the built-in utility class called shadow. The shadow class can be added to any HTML element to give it a shadow effect. 
Example: -->
<div class="shadow">This element has a shadow.</div>






<!-- By default, the shadow class applies a subtle shadow effect to the element. If you want a more pronounced or specific shadow style, Bootstrap also provides additional shadow classes:
shadow-sm: Applies a smaller, subtler shadow.
shadow-lg: Applies a larger, more pronounced shadow.
shadow-none: Removes the shadow effect.
Example: -->
<div class="shadow-lg">This element has a large shadow.</div>
