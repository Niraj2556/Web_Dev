Attributes and properties are not the same. Attributes are defined in HTML markup, while properties represent the current state of an element in the DOM. Using these attribute-related methods affects the attribute values but may not always reflect changes in the corresponding properties. To update properties, you can directly modify them using dot notation or by using property-specific methods.
