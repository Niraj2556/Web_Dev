// Let's compare the two provided code snippets in terms of execution speed and memory usage. Please note that the performance of code can vary based on the JavaScript engine and the specific environment in which it runs.

// Execution Speed:
// Code 1:

// It uses a for loop to iterate over the input string.
// The loop increments by 1 for each character.
// The logic involves comparing the current and next Roman numeral values.
// It may perform slightly better in terms of execution speed due to the direct array access.
// Code 2:

// It uses the forEach method on an array created from the input string.
// The logic involves comparing each character's value with the previous one.
// It may have a slightly higher overhead due to the functional programming style.
// In terms of execution speed, the differences between the two codes are likely to be minimal, and the actual performance might depend on the specific JavaScript engine.

// Memory Usage:
// Code 1:

// Uses a single result variable to store the final result.
// Uses constant values for Roman numerals stored in the sym object.
// Code 2:

// Uses result and prevValue variables to store intermediate values.
// Creates an array from the input string, potentially using additional memory.
// Both codes have relatively low memory usage, but Code 1 might have a slight advantage due to the more straightforward data structures.

// Conclusion:
// Both code snippets are quite efficient and have similar complexities. The differences in execution speed and memory usage are likely to be marginal. The choice between the two may depend on personal preference or specific requirements. It's recommended to consider readability and maintainability in addition to performance when choosing between these two implementations.
